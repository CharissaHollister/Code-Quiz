# Code Quiz - Javascript - for Boot Camp Students

Authored by Charissa Hollister 05/04/2022

## Description

Code Quiz - Javascript is an interactive quiz filled with multiple-choice questions about javascript and related processes. Players will be racing against a clock to see not only if they can finish in time, but if they can achieve the fastest score. Players should be weary though, because an incorrect answer deducts 10 seconds from the remaining time. <br />

## HTML, CSS and Script Functionality

5 separate screen set ups are present:<br />
-Starting Page<br />
-Question Pages<br />
-Results Page<br />
-High Score Page<br />
-Out of Time Page<br />
Player has 3 minutes to complete the quiz, if they do so a score is captured. If they do not complete in time they are given a message and directed to try again<br />
High scores will be held in local storage to allow for the player(s) to compete for the best score or to monitor improvement<br />
Player can access the current high scores without doing the quiz via the link in the header<br />
